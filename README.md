## General Idea

The Movie Recommendation and Sentiment Analysis React App is developed using React, a JavaScript library known for its efficient component-based architecture and seamless user interface rendering. It leverages the `TMDB API`, a popular source of movie-related data, to retrieve comprehensive details, including plot summaries, cast members, ratings, release dates, and more. The app incorporates a `content-based Machine Learning model` that employs techniques such as `bag of words` and `cosine similarities` to generate accurate and personalized `movie recommendations`. Furthermore, it utilizes `sentiment analysis`, a `Natural Language Processing` technique, to analyze the sentiment polarity of movie reviews, providing insights into the overall reception of a movie.

## Problem Solved

In today's vast and ever-expanding world of movies, it can be challenging for movie enthusiasts to discover new films that align with their preferences. Additionally, understanding the `general sentiment` surrounding a movie can be helpful for making informed viewing choices. With an overwhelming number of movies available, users often face the problem of finding relevant and `personalized recommendations`, as well as gauging the overall sentiment of a movie based on reviews.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Movie Recommendation and Sentiment Analysis React App is to address the aforementioned challenges and provide users with a `comprehensive movie browsing experience`. The app aims to solve the problem of discovering new movies by utilizing a content-based Machine Learning model that considers user preferences and generates accurate and personalized recommendations. By incorporating sentiment analysis, the app also offers users valuable insights into the `sentiment polarity` of movie reviews, aiding in their decision-making process.
